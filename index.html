<h1 class="WarNames"> Vietnam War </h1>

<p> The Vietnam War is one of the most hard fought wars in U.S. history. It lasted 19 years, and millions of lives were lost.<br>If you didn't know, the Vietnam War, was a war against North Vietnam, and South Vietnam. North Vietnam was communist, and they wanted South Vientnam to be communist too. So they started invading South Vietnam to make them communist, like them.</p>

<h1 class="OtherHeadings"> The Struggles and Dangers</h1>

<p class="strugglesDangers">The struggles of the Vietnam War were real, American and South Vietnam soliders were marching through the dense fog and rain of the Vietnam forests. They had to constantly swat away mosquitos while they were either shooting, or living as normally as a person in war could. Not only did these little pests bother soliders non-stop, they were forced to deal with the environment as well. The forests were dense, and you could usually see very little. The forest floor muddy and slippy. All while having to be on high alert, just in case in an enemey was nearby.<p>

<p class="strugglesDangers">The Dangers of the Vietnamese jungles were high. There were giant insects, Tigers, and even plants were against them! Many popular books don't really mention these dangers. And that is because of there somewhat "unimportance". If you want to read more about these dangers please click <a href="https://www.wearethemighty.com/mighty-history/things-troops-faced-vietnams-jungles/#:~:text=Venomous%20snakes&text=Vietnam%20has%20so%20many%20snakes,you%20in%20your%20jungle%20sleep." target="_blank">HERE</a></p>

<h1 id="Lastofthispage">Personal and Nesessary Items of a Solider</h1>
<p> Soliders coming from the U.S. and from just vietnamese vilages, and cities. Had many nessecities they took with them. These items included:</p>
<ul style="color:rgb(132,250,221); font-family:cursive;">
	<li>Bug spray
	<li>Toothpaste/ToothBrush
	<li>Books
	<li>Photos(etc.)
</ul>
<p> But maybe the most important things of them all were the burdons they carried from their families, and personal equipment. Many soliders had their family hanging over them. Maybe the fact that they had someone else in their families that were in wars. Or maybe the fact that they went to fight without the consent of their family. Many people who leave with the burdon of thier families, are weighed with the thought that they might never make it back to them. And they might die alone without them. These soliders usually have a trait that conflicts with the time period, and creates problems for them in and out of battle.</p>
